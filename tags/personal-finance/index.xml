      <description>‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | I Will Teach You to Be Rich - Ramit Sethi   On the second edition of the book, Ramit goes over everything that makes up your personal finance. This book is cleary aimed for the american crowd, with a large chunk of it dediacted to credit card debt management and psychology. This is the section that least interested me.
On the other hand, what I particularly love is that this book explains the promise and pitfalls of a lot of US financial products: credit card, checking account, saving account, 401K, Roth IRA.</description>
