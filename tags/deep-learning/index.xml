      <description>️️️Tracking Without Bells and Whistles ⭐️️️️️️️️⭐️️️️️️️️⭐️️️️️⭐️⭐️ | arXiv, GitHub  The motivation of this paper is to directly use a standard detector, such as Faster R-CNN, and exploits its bounding box regression capabilities for tracking purpose. In effect they transform a detector into what&amp;rsquo;s they call a Tracktor. Notably, they don&amp;rsquo;t use tracking data.
They reach state of the art performance and exceed them especially on difficulte situations (occlusions, etc.</description>

      <description>️️️SinGAN, Learning a Generative Model from a Single Natural Image ⭐️️️️️️️️⭐️️️️️⭐️⭐️ | arXiv, GitHub  SinGAN, short for Single GAN, is a GAN trained on a single image. It&amp;rsquo;s then used to generate sample from the same image.
 SinGAN sampling.   The same model can then be used to perform a lot of transformations including:
 image inpainting image editing image harmonization super-resolution video animation from one frame   SinGAN manipulations.</description>

      <description>️️️Mesh R-CNN ⭐️️️️️️️️⭐️️️️️⭐️ | arXiv  This new paper generates consistent and high-fidelity 3D shapes from 2D images. This is a large improvement on previous methods that used iterative shape deformation.
They proceed as follow:
 Use a usual R-CNN to produce a bounding box and 2D mask. Implement a new branch to cubify the image. Generate a cubed mesh. Align mesh with image. Refine voxel to mesh several times.</description>

      <description>️️️Towards best practice in explaining neural network decisions with LRP ⭐️️️️️⭐️⭐️ | arXiv, GitHub  The LRP or Layer-wise Relevance Propagation aims to explain which parts of an image matter. They achieve this by using a backpropagation where neurons that contribute the most received an increased weight.
 Layer-wise Relevance Propagation   This technique is very useful for images but also for other network or methodologies.
 Meaningful parts of the image.</description>

      <description>️️️️Understanding Deep Networks via Extremal Perturbations and Smooth Masks ⭐️️️️️️️⭐️️️️️️️️⭐️️️️️⭐️⭐️ | arXiv, GitHub  Very cool paper diving into interpretability! They identify the most relevant parts of an image for a classifier. Or said differently, the parts that best explain the prediction score.
Instead of the traditional approach of a rolling occlusion mask they instead 1) select a zone, 2) blur the rest of the image and 3) compute the prediction score.</description>
