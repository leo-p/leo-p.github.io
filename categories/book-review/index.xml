      <description>‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è | The Wonder Down Under - Nina Brochmann, Ellen Stokken Dahl   This book is to the women reproductive system what Giulia Enders&amp;rsquo;s book Gut was to our digestive system.
It goes through everything, point by point, in an effort to educate and cast away the myth from the reality. Anatomy, periods, sex, contraception, abortion and even known issues, everything goes.
As such it&amp;rsquo;s a must read, whether you&amp;rsquo;re a man or a woman!</description>

      <description>‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è | I Will Teach You to Be Rich - Ramit Sethi   On the second edition of the book, Ramit goes over everything that makes up your personal finance. This book is cleary aimed for the american crowd, with a large chunk of it dediacted to credit card debt management and psychology. This is the section that least interested me.
On the other hand, what I particularly love is that this book explains the promise and pitfalls of a lot of US financial products: credit card, checking account, saving account, 401K, Roth IRA.</description>
